This project is a Master Resumee that can be used by anyone, the source of the design came from https://www.rocketseat.com.br/ 

First HTML + CSS site 

1- Note that all CSS is embedded so all CSS in  the tag <style></style> 

2- The blocks of information are a DIV and with an ID that is “block 1,2,3,4,…”

3- The blocks are organized in a sequence that is from top to down and left to right after.

SO be aware that it means that block 1 is over block 2 and after that as well then at the end of the column, go to the right and the sequence continues.

4- the first block is the one with img profile

5- EACH block has its own tags and elements that are intuitive.

6- The CSS alignment that I used was flex-box.

7-This site is not mobile friendly

8-Pull requests are welcome.

9- THERE are two father DIV tags #maestro and #maestra that plays an important role to aling everything in a flex box with maestro dealing with the left side and maestra dealing with right side.

THERE are some sections that are not so let me show some of them.

#duck- block 3 —> it basically separes evenly all the technologies

<section > in block 7 for some reason I could not use a div so I changed for a section if you want to edit you are welcome.
